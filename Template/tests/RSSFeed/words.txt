Using the Mail Account Setup Wizard

To set up a mail or newsgroup account, first open the Window menu and choose Mail & Newsgroups. If you haven't already set up an account, the Account Wizard appears automatically, enabling you to set up an account.

The Account Wizard guides you through the process of creating a new account. If you don't know a setting, click Cancel and ask your Internet service provider (ISP) or help desk.

If an account already exists, the Account Wizard doesn't appear automatically when the Mail window opens. Instead, after opening the Mail window, open the File menu and choose New, then Account. For more details, see Setting Up Additional Mail & News Accounts.

 
Setting Up Mail Accounts with an ISP or Email Provider

Before you set up a mail account, your ISP or email provider should give you the following information:

    * your user name
    * your email address
    * the incoming and outgoing mail server names
    * the incoming server type (IMAP or POP)

Before you set up a newsgroup account, your ISP or email provider should give you the following information:

    * your email address
    * newsgroup server name
    * account name

To set up a new mail or newsgroup account, begin from the Mail window:

   1. Open the Edit menu and choose Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings. You see the Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box.
   2. Click Add Account to start the Account Wizard.

      The information requested by the Account Wizard depends on the type of new account you specify in its first window. The boldface headings that follow correspond to the windows you'll see when you're setting up an ISP or email provider account.
   3. New Account Setup: Choose the type of account you want to set up, then click Next.
   4. Identity: Enter the name and email address appropriate for this account, then click Next.
   5. Server Information: Indicate whether you want a POP account or an IMAP account. Not all service providers can support both options. For more information, see Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings - Server Settings.

      You must also provide the name of your incoming mail server and your outgoing server (SMTP) here. This is the name of the mail server that sends your messages (also known as the SMTP host). Click Next to continue.

      Note: You need to specify only one outgoing mail server (SMTP), even if you have several mail accounts. The name of your SMTP host may not have been explicitly listed in the account setup information provided to you. For example, your SMTP host may be the same as your POP or IMAP host. If in doubt, contact your ISP or system administrator.
   6. User Name: Enter the user name provided by your ISP or email provider, then click Next.
   7. Account Name: Enter whatever name you want to use to refer to this account, then click Next.
   8. Congratulations! Verify that the information you entered is correct. If necessary, verify the information you entered with your ISP or system administrator. When you are sure that it's correct, click Finish to set up your account.
   9. You see your new account listed in the left side of the Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box. Click OK to start using your new account.

You are now ready to retrieve messages from your account. For detailed instructions, see Getting New Messages.

   2. Choose Get All New Messages. Mozilla Mail & Newsgroups retrieves new messages for all your mail accounts.

      If you are not currently logged into one of your mail accounts, Mail & Newsgroups first prompts you to enter your user name and password before retrieving new messages for that account. (If you have already stored your user name and password using the Password Manager, Mail & Newsgroups doesn't prompt you for this information.)

Note: You can also open the File menu (in the Mail window) and choose "Get New Messages for".

To get new messages for a specific mail account, begin from the Mail window:

   1. Click the triangle on the Get Msgs button on the Mail toolbar.
   2. Choose the account for which you want to retrieve mail.

Composing Mail and Newsgroup Messages

You can address, compose, reply to, or send a new message by doing one of the following:

    * In any Mozilla window, open the File menu and choose New, then Message.
    * Click Compose on the Mail toolbar.
    * While displaying a message, click Reply, Forward, or Reply All on the Mail toolbar.
    * From the Address Book window, select an address and click Compose on the Address Book.

Tip: Use the Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings - Composition & Addressing dialog box to specify the HTML text editor to use for composing messages sent from this account. (You can specify a different editor for each of your accounts.) See Changing the Settings for an Account for more information.

Composing messages in HTML format allows you to use different fonts, text styles (such as bold or italic) and text colors, tables, numbered or bulleted lists, and pictures in your messages. However, some recipients may only be able to read messages composed in plain text format. If you want to use the plain-text editor occasionally, you can hold down the Shift key while clicking the Compose or the Reply button to use the plain-text editor on an as-needed basis.

[ Return to beginning of section ]
Using the Message Composition Window

Use the Compose window to address, compose, and send mail and newsgroup messages. First specify whether you want to compose messages in plain text or HTML by default in the Composition & Addressing Preferences panel (open the Edit menu and choose Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings).

To view the Compose window, click the Compose button on the Mail toolbar.

The Compose window contains the following:

    * Mail Toolbar
    *

      You can click the following buttons:
          o Send: To send a completed message.
          o Address: To search for names in your address books.
          o Attach: To attach a file to a message. See Using Attachments for more information.
          o Spell: To check the spelling of your message text.
          o Security: To display information about whether your message will be sent encrypted or digitally signed (or both).
          o Save: To save the message as a draft.
    * Addressing area: Where you enter the email addresses of recipients.
    * Attachments area: When you attach files to a message (by clicking in this area or by clicking the Attach button), the filenames will be listed in the Attachments area to the right of the Addressing area.
    * Message body area: Where you type the contents of your message.

If you've chosen to compose messages using the HTML editor, you see an additional toolbar with text formatting buttons similar to those in Mozilla Composer.

For help using the HTML editor, see Formatting Your Web Pages.

[ Return to beginning of section ]
Addressing a Message

To address a mail message:

   1. Type the name in the addressing area.
   2.

      If you have address autocompletion enabled (it's enabled by default), type the first few letters of the recipient's name and wait for Mail & Newsgroups to complete the address. (Or you can type part of the name and immediately press Enter to have Mail & Newsgroups try to complete the address.)
   3. If multiple addresses are displayed, select an address and press Enter.
   4.

      Note: Use a comma to separate multiple addresses on the same line. Do not use a comma to separate first or last names. For example, multiple entries might be:

      user1@netscape.net,user2@netscape.net
   5. If you want this message to be sent from a different account, click the "From" field to select the account you want. See Changing the Account From Which a Message is Sent for more information.
   6. If necessary, click "To" to choose a different recipient type:
   7.
          * To: For primary recipients of your message.
          * Cc: For secondary recipients (carbon copy).
          * Bcc: For secondary recipients not identified to the other recipients, including those in the cc list (blind carbon copy).
          * Reply-To: For recipients to reply to a different email address other than the one the message is sent from.
          * Newsgroup: For posting to a newsgroup.
          * Followup-To: For redirecting a newsgroup posting, so that subsequent replies go directly to the redirected newsgroup instead of the original newsgroup.

Tip: You can quickly address a message by clicking the email address contained in a message you're reading, and then selecting Compose Mail To from the pop-up menu.

Changing the Account From Which a Message is Sent

If you have multiple mail accounts, the account listed in the From field is based on the account (or server) you selected when you choose to create a new message. However, Mozilla Mail & Newsgroups also allows you to change the account a message is sent from while you're composing a message. Click the From field to view a list of your accounts and then select the account you want. A copy of the message is saved in the Sent folder of the account where you sent the message from.

About Address Autocompletion

Address autocompletion allows you to address mail easily from the Compose window without having to search for names or type complete names. Mail & Newsgroups automatically checks your address books and an LDAP directory server (if available) and completes the name if it finds a unique match. It also prevents mistakes by showing all possible choices with additional information if it finds multiple matches. Address autocompletion is enabled by default.

If you don't want to use an address that Mail & Newsgroups provides, press Backspace or Delete to remove characters and then enter an alternate address.

To disable address autocompletion:

   1. Open the Edit menu (Mozilla menu on Mac OS X) and choose Preferences.
   2. Under the Mail & Newsgroups category, click Addressing. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Mail & Newsgroups to expand the list).
   3. In the Address Autocompletion section, deselect "Local Address Books" and "Directory Server."
   4. Click OK.

[ Return to beginning of section ]
Selecting Message Sending Options

While you're composing a message, you can select these additional message sending options from the Options menu:

    * Select Addresses: The Select Addresses option lets you choose the recipient's email address from your Address Books or a remote directory. To look up an address in an address book or directory, enter the first few letters of the recipient's first or last name to start the search. Select an address and then click To:, Cc:, or Bcc: to address your message.
    * Check Spelling: Checks the spelling of the message text before you send it. You can also click Spell.
    * Rewrap: If you are composing a message using the plain-text editor, you can use the Rewrap command to rewrap long lines of quoted text to fit the Compose window. This command rewraps selected quoted text to the number of characters specified by the Composition preferences. This command is primarily useful when you are replying to a message where the original message is quoted in your reply, and the original message contains long lines.

      You use the Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings command on the Edit menu to specify that you want to use the plain-text editor for composing messages. Select the Composition & Addressing panel of the account and uncheck "Compose messages in HTML format" to use the plain-text editor for all messages. If you only want to use the plain-text editor occasionally, you can hold down the Shift key while clicking the Compose or the Reply button to use the plain-text editor on an as-needed basis.
    * Return Receipt: Choose this option to request a confirmation message when the recipient displays (opens) the message. Keep in mind that the recipient may choose not to send you a return receipt. This option lets you enable or disable return receipt requests on a per-message basis. To automatically request return receipts for all messages you send, use the return receipts preferences. See Mail & Newsgroups Preferences - Return Receipts for more information.
    * Format: Send the message as plain text, or HTML (formatted), or both. If you choose "Auto-Detect," Mail & Newsgroups prompts you for the format to use if it's unknown whether the recipient's mail program can display an HTML message. The format you choose here overrides the send format you specified using the Preferences command on the Edit menu (Mozilla menu on Mac OS X).
    * Priority: Choose a priority to indicate whether the message has lowest, low, normal, high, or highest priority.
    * Send a Copy To: Choose this if you want to file an additional copy of the sent message in a different folder than your default Sent folder. Then select the folder you want.
    * Security: Choose this to change the default security options for this message.

[ Return to beginning of section ]
Replying to a Message

To reply to a mail message:

    * Select the message.
    * Click Reply to respond to the sender alone.
    * Click Reply All to respond to all addressees in the message.

To include the original message each time you reply to any message, and to specify how to place the original message in the reply:

   1. Open the Edit menu and choose Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings. You see the Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box.
   2. If you have multiple accounts, select an account and click the Composition & Addressing category for that account.
   3. Select "Automatically quote the original message when replying".
   4. Specify where in the message to place your reply. "Start my reply below the quote" is the default.
   5. If you have decided to attach a signature to every outgoing message and selected to start your reply above the quote here, you can additionally configure where your signature is placed:
          * Select "below the quote (recommended)" to place your signature at the very end of the message below the quoted text.
          * Select "below my reply (above the quote)" to place your signature between your reply and the quoted text.
   6. Click OK.

[ Return to beginning of section ]
Forwarding a Message

When you forward a message, you can specify how to place new text relative to the original text: inline (in the body of the message; this is the default), or as an attachment.

To forward a message:

   1. Select the message and click Forward.
   2. Type the name or email address of the recipient.
   3. Click Send.

To set the default for forwarding messages:

   1. Open the Edit menu (Mozilla menu on Mac OS X) and choose Preferences.
   2. Under the Mail & Newsgroups category, click Composition. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Mail & Newsgroups to expand the list.)
   3. For forwarding messages, choose Inline (in the message body) or As Attachment.
   4. Click OK.

Tip: To override the default for forwarding a message, select the message, open the Message menu, and choose Forward As, then choose Inline or Attachment.

[ Return to beginning of section ]
Confirming That Your Message Was Opened

You can use return receipts to notify you when a recipient has displayed (opened) your message. The recipient must be using a mail program that supports the Message Disposition Notification (MDN) standard. Keep in mind that the recipient may choose not to send you a return receipt, even if you've requested one. Messages you send to a newsgroup address will not include a return receipt request, since news servers don't support this feature.

To request return receipts for all messages you send, you can use the global Return Receipt preferences to specify how to manage requests you receive for return receipts. You can override these global preferences for individual accounts.

To request a return receipt on a per-message basis:

    * From a Mail Compose window, open the Options menu, and choose Return Receipt.

To automatically request return receipts when sending messages from each of your mail accounts:

   1. Open the Edit menu (Mozilla menu on Mac OS X) and choose Preferences.
   2. Under the Mail & Newsgroups category, click Return Receipts. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Mail & Newsgroups to expand the list.)
   3. Select "When sending messages, always request a return receipt."
   4. Click OK.

For more information on setting return receipt preferences, see Mail & Newsgroups Preferences - Return Receipts.

HTML messages can include formatted text, links, images, and tables just like a web page. However, some recipients may not be able to receive HTML messages. Mozilla Mail & Newsgroups allows you to compose mail and newsgroup messages using either the HTML (rich-text) formatting editor or the plain-text editor for each mail account you have. In addition, you can choose whether your addressees should receive HTML or plain-text messages by default, and how Mail & Newsgroups should handle messages when it's not known if an addressee can receive HTML-formatted mail.

To specify whether to use the HTML editor as the default for composing messages, begin from the Mail window:

   1. Open the Edit menu and choose Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings. You see the Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box.
   2. Select the mail or newsgroup account you want to use.
   3. Go to the Composition & Addressing panel and select "Compose messages in HTML format." You see the Formatting toolbar in the Compose window. Leave this box unchecked to use the plain-text editor for this account.

Editing or Inserting HTML Elements

If you understand how to work with HTML source code, you can edit or insert additional HTML tags, style attributes, and JavaScript in your mail message. If you are not sure how to work with HTML source code, it's best not to change it. To work with HTML code, use one of these methods:

    * Place the insertion point where you want to insert the HTML code, then open the Insert menu and choose HTML. In the Insert HTML dialog box, enter HTML tags and text, and then click Insert to insert your changes.
    * Select the HTML source code that you want to edit, then open the Insert menu and choose HTML. In the Insert HTML dialog box, edit HTML tags and text, and then click Insert to insert your changes.
    * Select an element such as a table, named anchor, image, link, or horizontal line. Double-click the element to open the associated properties dialog box for that item. Click Advanced Edit to open the Advanced Property Editor. You can use the Advanced Property Editor to add HTML attributes and JavaScript to objects.

For more information on editing HTML source code, see Using the Advanced Property Editor.

Choosing HTML Mail Sending Options

By default, Mail & Newsgroups prompts you before sending HTML messages when it's not known whether the recipient's mail program can display HTML-formatted messages.

To choose sending-format options for mail messages, begin from the Mail window:

   1. Open the Edit menu (Mozilla menu on Mac OS X) and choose Preferences.
   2. Under the Mail & Newsgroups category, click Send Format. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Mail & Newsgroups to expand the list).

      Note: This preference applies only to mail messages, not to newsgroup messages.
   3. Select the option you want and then click OK.

If while composing a message you realize that one or more recipients may not be able to receive HTML-formatted mail, you can easily convert the message to a different format when you click Send:

   1. In the Compose window, open the Options menu and choose Format.
   2. Select the format you want to use for sending the message from the submenu:
   3.
          * Auto Detect: Mail & Newsgroups chooses the appropriate format for the message text. If it can't determine the format, it asks you to choose a format.
          * Plain Text Only: The message may not display formatting such as bold text, but all mail programs will be able to display the message.
          * Rich Text (HTML) Only: Some mail programs may have trouble displaying an HTML-formatted message. Choose this option only if you are sure the recipient's mail program can display HTML-formatted mail.
          * Plain and Rich (HTML) Text: This uses more disk space, but may be the best choice if you are not sure whether the recipient's mail program can display HTML-formatted mail.
   4. When you've finished composing the message, click Send.

   5.

      If this recipient can only read messages sent as plain text (no formatting), then choose Plain Text. If you don't know or are not sure, choose Unknown.

      If you choose Unknown, Mozilla Mail & Newsgroups determines the sending format based on the Send Format settings for Mail & Newsgroups in the Preferences dialog box. If Mail & Newsgroups still can't determine the correct format, it will prompt you to choose a sending format when you send the message.
   6. Click OK.

[ Return to beginning of section ]
Viewing and Opening Attachments

If you receive a mail attachment that consists of a file type that Mozilla can display (such as graphic files and HTML files), you see the attachment displayed inline (in the body of the message). For other file types, Mail & Newsgroups lets you open the attachment using another application, or you can save the attachment on your hard disk.

To open the attachment, make sure you have a program on your computer that can open files of the same type as the attachment's file format. For example, if you want to open a .DOC file, make sure you have a program on your computer that can open .DOC files.

To open an attachment:

   1. Double-click the attachment you want (if there is more than one).
   2. In the Downloading dialog box, choose what you want Mozilla to do with the attachment:


          * If Mozilla finds an application on your hard disk that can open the attachment, you can open the attachment using that application. Click "Choose" to use a different application to open the attachment.
          * If Mozilla can't find an application on your hard disk that can open the attachment, you can save the attachment. You won't be able to open the attachment, but at least you can save it on your hard disk until you can install an application that can open it.
          * Click "Advanced" to add a new file type to the list of helper applications. Mozilla uses helper applications to determine how different file types are opened by other applications from within Mozilla. For more information, see Managing Different File Types.
   3. Click OK.

Note: If you are viewing your mail using an IMAP mail server, all attachments remain on the server.

    * Adding and Removing LDAP Directories

About Address Books

Address books store email addresses and contact information for people
you typically send mail to, such as colleagues, friends, and
family. Mozilla Mail & Newsgroups provides you with two address books:
the Personal Address Book and the Collected Addresses Book and you can create additional address books as well. You can also import address books from other mail programs and previous versions of Mozilla. The contents of these address books are stored locally on your hard disk.

Your address book may also list email addresses from an LDAP directory, which is located on an LDAP directory server. The directory server stores email addresses of people that are not included in your locally-stored address books. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an industry-standard method for accessing Internet or intranet directory services such as corporate address books.
Personal Address Book

Use the Personal Address Book to add specific names of your choice. You can create mailing lists and edit individual address entries.
Collected Addresses

By default, the Collected Address Book automatically collects the email addresses contained in outgoing mail messages. Addresses from outgoing messages are stored in the Collected Address Book as soon as you click Send. The Collected Address Book can also save the sender's address in each incoming message. To enable this feature, you must change the preferences for email address collection. The preferences also let you choose which types of addresses you want to collect (only addresses from mail messages or addresses from both mail and newsgroup messages).
LDAP Directory (if available)

An LDAP directory (also known as an address lookup service) stores email addresses of recipients who are not in your locally-stored address books. LDAP directories offer you access to large, centrally maintained databases of email addresses, which is especially useful with address autocompletion.

Automatic address collection is enabled by default. To change automatic address collection settings, begin in the Mail window:

   1. Open the Edit menu (Mozilla menu on Mac OS X) and choose Preferences.
   2. Under the Mail & Newsgroups category, click Addressing. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Mail & Newsgroups to expand the list.)
   3. Under Email Address Collection, choose whether you want to:


          * Use this feature for incoming or outgoing messages, or both.
          * Use this feature for newsgroup messages.
          * Limit the size of the Collected Address book. The default size is 700 cards. If you add a new card that exceeds the limit, the oldest card is removed and the new card is added, keeping the total number of cards the same.
   4. Click OK.


Opening the Address Book Window

To open the Address Book window:

    * Open the Window menu and choose Address Book, or click the Address Book icon in the lower-left corner of any Mozilla window.
    *
        	Address Book icon

                o Prefers to receive messages formatted as: If you know this recipient can read HTML-formatted messages (such as messages that include links, images, or tables), choose HTML. If this recipient can only read messages sent as plain text (no formatting), then choose Plain Text. If you don't know or are not sure, choose Unknown. If you choose Unknown, Mozilla Mail & Newsgroups determines the sending format based on the Mail & Newsgroups Send Format settings in the Preferences dialog box. If Mail & Newsgroups still can't determine the correct format, Mail & Newsgroups will prompt you to choose a sending format when you send the message.
                o Phones (enter phone numbers for this person)
          * Address: Type additional information such as street address, phone number, and URL.

Filing Messages in Folders

You can move messages from one folder to another by using either of these methods:

    * Select the message, click the File button on the toolbar, and choose the destination folder.
    * Drag and drop messages into the desired folder.
    *

      Note: If you drag and drop a message from an IMAP or POP mail server folder to a local folder on your hard drive, the message is moved to the local folder and removed from the server folder.

To copy a message from one folder to another:

   1. Select the message and right-click to display the pop-up menu.
   2. Select "Copy To" and then select the destination account and folder from the drop-down list.

Sharing Folders With Other Users (IMAP Only)

Users with IMAP mail accounts can share mail folders with other users on the same network. Sharing folders allows several users to see and work with the same messages, similar to a newsgroup. To use shared folders, your IMAP mail server must support Access Control List (ACL) management. Check with your system administrator or help desk if you are not sure that shared folders are supported by your IMAP mail server.

To share a mail folder with other users on your network, or to view sharing information for a folder, begin from the Mail window:

   1. Within an IMAP account, select a folder that you want to share, or select a folder whose sharing privileges you want to view.

      Folders listed under Local Folders, or folders listed under a POP mail account cannot be shared.
   2. Open the Edit menu, and choose Folder Properties.
   3. Click the Sharing tab.
   4. Click Privileges. You may be prompted to enter your network user name and password.

      The Privileges button is only available if the IMAP mail server allows you to set folder sharing privileges. If this button is not available, you can view the folder sharing privileges for this folder but cannot change them.
   5. Follow the instructions on the screen to add users and to set their folder access privileges.


          * Read privileges: Users can read messages and copy their contents, but they cannot modify or delete messages, or copy messages into the folder. Users can flag messages as read or unread. See Marking or Flagging Messages for instructions on flagging messages.
          * Read and Write privileges: In addition to Read privileges, users can modify and delete messages. Users can also copy or move messages into the folder.
          * Manage privileges: In addition to Read and Write privileges, users can add and remove users and change their folder permissions.
   6. Click OK to confirm your changes.
   7. Click OK to close the Folder Properties dialog box.

In the list of folders for your mail account, a shared folder displays a distinctive folder icon to indicate that it is shared.

To send a message that tells others how they can subscribe to your shared folder, begin from the Mail window:

   1. Select the shared folder.
   2. Right-click to display a pop-up menu, and choose Copy Folder Location.
   3. Click Compose to display a Mail compose window.
   4. Click in the message body, open the Edit menu, and choose Paste.
   5. Address the message, type a subject, and type the message text. Tell message recipients that they can subscribe to the shared folder by clicking the link you pasted into the message.

      Only message recipients who share the same network will be able to subscribe to your shared folder.
   6. Click Send.

Subscribing to a Shared Folder

Subscribing to a shared folder is similar to subscribing to a newsgroup. To subscribe to a shared folder, begin from the Mail window:

Labeling Messages

You can apply labels to messages to help you organize and prioritize them. You can apply a standard color and text label to messages, or you can customize the label colors or label text to suit your needs.

One powerful way to use labels is to set up a message filter to automatically label incoming messages from a specific sender. For example, you can set up a message filter so that incoming messages from your boss are labeled "Important" and appear in red. See Creating Message Filters for more information.
Applying a Label

To apply a label to a message, begin from the Mail window:

   1. Select the message you want to label.
   2. Open the Message menu, and choose Label.
   3. Choose the label you want to apply from the list.

The message header changes to the label color you chose. To see the label text, you must display the Label column in the Mail window.

Tip: To quickly label messages or remove a label, select one or more messages and press 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 on your keyboard. Press 0 to remove a label.

To display the Label column, begin from the Mail window:

    * Click the Show/Hide Columns icon and select Label from the list.

Note: Message labels apply on a per-account basis. For example, if you move or copy a labeled message to another mail account, the label is not preserved. Similarly, if you forward a labeled message to another recipient, the label is not preserved. For IMAP mail accounts, if your IMAP server supports user-defined keywords, message labels will persist when you log in to your mail account from a different location.

[ Return to beginning of section ]
Customizing Labels

You can customize label colors or text to suit your needs.

To customize labels, begin from the Mail window:

   1. Open the Edit menu (Mozilla menu on Mac OS X) and choose Preferences. You see the Preferences dialog box.

          *

            Note: Filters are applied to each incoming message in the order you choose, until a filter action results in the message being deleted or moved to the Inbox folder.
   5. Click OK when you are done managing your filters. If you created a new filter, it begins filtering incoming messages as soon as you click OK.

Note: If you delete a folder that you've been using to store filtered messages, the filter will no longer work. Incoming messages that match the filter criteria will appear in your Inbox. If you rename or move the folder, the filter will automatically update to use the renamed or moved folder.

Tip: Filters don't apply to existing messages. If you have existing messages that you want to move to another folder, you can search for those messages and then file them into the other folder.

Controlling Junk Mail

This section describes how to use Mozilla's Junk Mail Controls to filter unwanted mail.
In this section:

    * Using Junk Mail Controls
    * Junk Mail Controls Options
    * Junk Mail Controls and Filters

Using Junk Mail Controls

Mozilla's Junk Mail Controls feature can evaluate your incoming messages and identify possible junk (or unsolicited) messages. The feature uses the Bayesian classification method. You first train Mozilla by showing it a bunch of mail that is junk, and a bunch of mail that is not. Then, you let it auto-classify new mail for you. If Mozilla makes any mistakes, you can correct them.

To use Junk Mail Controls:

   1. First, train Mozilla to recognize Junk messages and Non-Junk messages. There are three ways to toggle junk status of the selected message(s):
          * Open the Tools menu, and choose Mark Selected Messages or Mark Selected Messages as Not Junk.
          * Click on the Junk toolbar button.
          *

            Click to toggle the Junk Status column in the message list. (If you do not see it, click the right-most button () in the list header bar and select Junk Status from the pop-up menu.)

      When you toggle junk status, a trash-can icon will appear or disappear in the Junk status column to indicate the junk status of the selected message.
   2. Open the Tools menu and choose Junk Mail Controls.... Enable the feature for your mail account, and Mozilla will automatically classify incoming messages. (See Junk Mail Controls Options.)
   3. If you have trained it on virus mail, consider disabling the white listing (many mail viruses send bulk messages to people in the address book of the infected computer).
   4. Make sure to correct the Junk Mail Controls when it incorrectly labels messages either as junk or not junk.
   5. To analyze existing messages, select messages, open the Tools menu and choose Run Junk Mail Controls.

Note: Mozilla will only run Junk Mail Controls when the training database has information on non-Junk messages. If Junk Mail Controls does not work, select some messages and explicitly mark them as Not Junk.

[ Return to beginning of section ]
Junk Mail Controls Options

To fine-tune how Junk Mail Controls works, open the Tools menu and choose Junk Mail Controls...:

    * Account: Choose an mail account to change the Junk Mail Controls settings for that account. (Note: all accounts share the same Junk training database.)
    * Junk Mail Log: Click the button to open a dialog showing you the history of Junk mail detections. You can disable Junk Mail Log from the dialog.
    * Enable Junk Mail Controls: Toggle this option to activate or deactivate junk mail classification.
    * Do not mark messages as junk mail if the sender is in my address book: Choose this option to prevent messages from people you know inadvertently classified as junk mail.
    * Move incoming messages determined to be junk mail to: Check this option to automatically move messages flagged as Junk to a special folder.
          o "Junk" folder on [account]: select this to use the default Junk folder.
          o Other: [account]: select this to choose your own custom-named junk folder.
          o Automatically delete junk messages older than __ days from this folder: If you are confident old messages classified as junk are indeed junk mail, check this option to automatically delete old junk messages after a grace period.
    * When I manually mark messages as Junk: Choose this to set what you want Mozilla to do when you manually mark messages as Junk.
          o Move them to the "Junk" folder: Choose this to move manually-marked Junk messages to the Junk folder.
          o Delete them: Choose this to move manually-marked Junk messages to the trash folder.

Junk Mail Controls and Filters

Junk Mail Controls runs after mail mail filters and applies only to the Inbox folder and its sub-folders. Use this to your advantage, for example, you can filter mail you are sure not to be Junk to a special folder outside of Inbox so that the messages will not be classified as Junk (especially useful if you subscribe to newsletters or if you are on a moderated mailing list).

Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings - Server Settings

Mozilla Mail & Newsgroups can work with two types of mail servers: IMAP and POP. If you are not sure which server type your Internet service provider supports, ask your service provider. If your Internet service provider supports both, the following descriptions may help you choose which one to use.
In this section:

    * About Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
    * About Internet Post Office Protocol (POP)
    * IMAP Server Settings
    * Advanced IMAP Server Settings
    * POP Server Settings
    * News Server Settings

[ Return to beginning of section ]
About Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)

Advantages: Your messages and any changes to them stay on your server, saving local disk space. Also, you always have access to an updated mailbox, and you can get your mail from multiple locations. Performance on a modem is faster, since you initially download message headers only.

Disadvantages: Not all ISPs support IMAP.

[ Return to beginning of section ]
About Post Office Protocol (POP)

Advantages: Your messages are downloaded to your local computer all at once, but you can also specify whether to keep copies of the messages on the server and delete messages on the server when they are deleted locally. Most ISPs currently support POP.

Disadvantages: If you use more than one computer, messages might reside on one or the other, but not both. POP doesn't work as well as IMAP over a slow link connection. Also, you can't access all mail folders from multiple locations.

Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings - Security

This section describes how to configure the Mail & Newsgroup Account Settings that control mail message security. Before you do so, however, you must obtain one or more mail certificates. For details, see Signing & Encrypting Messages.

If you are not already viewing the Security settings for your mail account, begin from the Mail window:

   1. Open the Edit menu and choose Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings.
   2. Click Security under the name of the mail account whose security settings you want to configure.

In this section:

    * About Certificates
    * Digital Signing
    * Encryption

About Certificates

The main purpose of the Security panel in Mail & Newsgroup Account Settings is to select two certificates:

    * The email certificate you want to use for signing mail messages you send to other people.
    * The email certificate you want other people to use when they encrypt messages they send to you.

Depending on the policies of the certificate authority (CA) that issues your certificate(s), you can use one certificate for both purposes or two different certificates. Even if you use just one, you must specify it twice, once for digital signing and once for encryption.

The certificates you select here are included with every signed message you send. These certificates allow your recipients to verify your digital signature and to encrypt messages that they send to you.

 
Digital Signing

You use the Digital Signing area in the Security panel to specify how you want to sign your email messages:

    * Digitally sign messages: Select this checkbox if you want to digitally sign all the messages you send. (A personal certificate must be specified below before you can select this checkbox.)
    * Use this certificate to digitally sign messages you send: If this field is empty or if it displays the wrong certificate, click Select to choose from the certificates you have on file.

Regardless of whether the "Digitally sign messages" checkbox is selected here, you can change your mind before you send an individual message.

To change the digital signature setting for a message you are writing in the Compose window, click the arrow below the Security icon near the top of the window and select or deselect "Digital Sign This Message". For details, see Signing & Encrypting a New Message.
Encryption

You use the Encryption area in the Security panel to specify how you routinely want to use encryption when sending your messages:

    * Never: Select this option if you never want to use encryption, or only occasionally.
    * Required: Select this option if you always want to use encryption. If you don't have all the necessary certificates, the message won't be sent unless you explicitly turn off encryption for that message only.
    * Use this certificate to encrypt & decrypt messages sent to you: If this field is empty or if it displays the wrong certificate, click Select to choose from the certificates you have on file.

Regardless of which encryption option you select, you can change your mind before you send an individual message.

To change the encryption setting for a message you are writing in the Compose window, click the arrow below the Security icon near the top of the window and choose the encryption setting you want. For details, see Signing & Encrypting a New Message.

Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings - Local Folders

Local Folders is the account where Mozilla Mail & Newsgroups saves any messages that you send while working offline. Messages you send while working offline are saved in the Unsent Messages folder under Local Folders. Any folders you create under the Local Folders account reside on your hard disk, so Local Folders is a good place to save messages that you want to keep.

If you are not already viewing the Local Folders settings, begin from the Mail window:

   1. Open the Edit menu and choose Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings. You see the Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box.
   2. Select the Local Folders category.

    * Account Name: The name associated with the Local Folders account.

Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings - Outgoing Server (SMTP)

The outgoing server will transport your outgoing mail to the intended recipients.

If you are not already viewing the Outgoing Server (SMTP) settings, begin from the Mail window:

   1. Click on any Mail window.
   2. From the Edit menu, choose Mail & Newsgroup Account Settings.
   3. Select Outgoing Server (SMTP) and set up as follows (If you are not sure which option to choose, check with your ISP or system administrator):

    * Server name: The SMTP server that will deliver your outgoing mail. To use a different SMTP server, change this field.
    * Port: The port on which the SMTP server will be connected. By default it holds the standard port for the specified encryption. Change it if the mail server is listening for connections on a non-standard port.
    * Use name and password: If your SMTP server requires authentication to send mail, select this option and enter your user name. The first time you send mail, you will be prompted for your password. At that time you can instruct Mozilla to save your password for future sessions.
    * Use secure connection: If your outgoing server is configured to support an encrypted connection, choose one of the following (if you make a choice for which your server is not configured, you will get an error message when sending mail):
          o No: If you don't want to use an encrypted link.
          o TLS, if available: Mozilla will try to use a TLS encrypted connection. If the server doesn't support it, an unencrypted connection is used.
          o TLS: Require a TLS encrypted connection. This mechanism will mostly run on the standard SMTP port 25.
          o SSL: Require a SSL encrypted connection. The default port for this is 465.
    * Advanced: Click this option to set up additional SMTP servers or to change the default SMTP server.

Choose to use the default character encoding for outgoing messages even when replying.
    * Defaults for HTML Messages: Here you can define what the defaults are for font, size, text and background color if you choose to send mails in HTML format.

[ Return to beginning of section ]
Mail & Newsgroups Preferences - Send Format

Send Format preferences allow you to specify how you want to format your outgoing messages. If you are not already viewing the Send Format settings, follow these steps:

   1. Open the Edit menu (Mozilla menu on Mac OS X) and choose Preferences. You see the Preferences dialog box.
   2. Under the Mail & Newsgroups category, click Send Format. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Mail & Newsgroups to expand the list.)

    * Ask me what to do: This option requires Mail & Newsgroups to prompt you to choose a format before you send the message.
    * Convert the message to plain text: This option may cause your message to lose formatting such as bold text.
    * Send the message in HTML anyway: If you select this option, keep in mind that some mail programs may have trouble displaying the message.
    * Send the message in both plain text and HTML: This option uses more disk space.
    *

      You can always override these preferences for an individual message by using the Options menu in the Mail Compose window.
    * HTML and Plain Text Domains: Use the Add button to add the domain names that you typically send mail to, if you know which domains can display HTML-formatted mail messages, and which domains can only display plain text.

For example, if you typically send mail to multiple recipients that have the same domain name (for example, your colleagues all have email addresses that end in "netscape.net"), and you know that this domain name is capable of displaying HTML messages, then you can add the netscape.net domain to the list of HTML Domains so that Mail & Newsgroups will automatically send messages in HTML format to these recipients.

Similarly, if you typically send mail to recipients at a domain that you know can only receive Plain Text messages, you can add that domain name to the list of Plain Text domains, so that Mail & Newsgroups automatically sends messages to that domain in plain-text format.

Note: If you regularly compose HTML (formatted) mail messages, keep in mind that sometimes not all recipients use mail programs that can display HTML formatting properly. Send Format preferences allow you to specify how you want to format messages that go to recipients who cannot display HTML-formatted mail. You can convert messages to plain text, format them only as HTML, or format them as both HTML and plain text. These preferences apply to all your mail accounts, but only to mail messages and not to newsgroup messages.

Whenever you add a person or address card to your address book, you can specify whether that addressee can receive HTML-formatted messages. However, when this information is unknown, you can set Send Format preferences for how Mail & Newsgroups formats these messages.

Mail & Newsgroups Preferences - Addressing

Addressing preferences allow you to control the settings for Mozilla Mail & Newsgroups address books (for example, email address collection and address autocompletion). If you are not already viewing the Addressing settings, follow these steps:

   1. Open the Edit menu (Mozilla menu on Mac OS X) and choose Preferences. You see the Preferences dialog box.
   2. Under the Mail & Newsgroups category, select Addressing. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Mail & Newsgroups to expand the list.)

    * Email Address Collection: Select how Mail & Newsgroups will add senders' and recipients' addresses to your Collected Addresses book (from incoming, outgoing, or newsgroup messages).

      Note: In addition to your Personal Address Book, Mozilla Mail & Newsgroups provides you with a Collected Addresses Book that can automatically store email addresses from your incoming or outgoing messages, or both. By default, email addresses contained in outgoing messages are stored as soon as you click Send. If you choose "Incoming Mail Messages," Mail & Newsgroups stores the sender's address in each message as soon as you open it. Any changes you make to these settings take effect the next time you start Mozilla.
    * Address Autocompletion: Address autocompletion allows you to quickly address mail without having to search for names or type names completely. Select from which location Mail & Newsgroups will search for matching addresses: "Local Address Books" (Personal Address Book, Collected Addresses Book, or any other local address book) or "Directory Server" (an available LDAP directory server) or both.

      Note: If while addressing mail, multiple email address matches are found, Mail & Newsgroups displays a list of all possible choices.

      If you select Directory Server, choose a directory server from the list. A directory server lets you look up addresses that are not stored in one of your local address books. The directory you select will also be searched for matching certificates when you attempt to send an encrypted message to one or more recipients for whom you don't have certificates on file.

      See Adding and Removing LDAP Directories for information on setting LDAP directory server settings.

      Note: Directory server settings you enter from the Preferences dialog box apply to all your mail accounts. You can override these settings for individual accounts by specifying different LDAP directory servers or server settings using the Addressing settings for an account in the Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box. To set different addressing options for a specific account, open the Edit menu and choose Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings.
